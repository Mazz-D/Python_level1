# The Files aarangment
All my code base in each chapter is commented out from the beginning with the 3 quote style(""") from the beginning of each read and at it's end
Within the code are also single line comments(#) used to indicate code difference
This occurs in both the chapter read through examples and as well as the chapters' follow up 'Try it' exercises
